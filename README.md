# Audrino_Music_Player
Our project is to design and construct an Arduino based wireless music player system, to transmit stereo audio from a 3.5 mm jack to play on a pair of speakers. The Arduino in the circuit loads the .wav files from the micro-SD card. It then generates a signal and outputs it through the speaker connected to digital pin 9. This allows the speaker to create sounds and play music. We can also play/Pause the song by pressing the button connected to pin 5. Press it once to pause the song and press it again to play it from where it stopped and we can use the button attached with pin 7 for previous song and pin 6 for next song.
